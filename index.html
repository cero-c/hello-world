     <h2 class="box2">Why am I here?</h2>
    <p>Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations in 2019 wasn't just powerful—it was a wake-up call. At just 16, she showed the world that one voice can spark change, no matter how small it seems. Her courage reminded us that even the simplest actions, when taken seriously, can make a big difference for our planet.
    
    Inspired by her resilience, I created this website to share small, practical ways you can protect our blue home. From tiny daily habits to smarter choices, these tips are here to help you make a positive impact—because just like Greta showed, change starts with each of us daring to act.</p>
